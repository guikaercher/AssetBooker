# Assets Booker

## What is this?
This is my first ever deployied app.
It should be usefull for booking assets, for example if you have some servers at your company that employes use to make tests on them you could lend the hardware for x time and with this tool you can control who is using what and for how long.

## How to use it?
In progress...

## Why?
The goal here was to have something published on github so people could see some code I made on my own.
Also I tried to implement some concepts I learnt:
- Repository pattern
- Componentization
- Functional Programming
- KISS
- S --> Single-responsiblity principle
- O --> Open-closed principle
- <s> L --> Liskov substitution principle </s> This one I don't have enough knwoledge yet
- <s> I --> Interface segregation principle </s> This one I don't have enough knwoledge yet
- D --> Dependency Inversion Principle
- LEAN development
- Git Flow

## Requests format
Soon...
